# MPS Connect Governance Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the comprehensive governance implementation for MPS Connect, covering immutable audit logs, compliance tracking, and regulatory requirements.

## Governance Architecture

### **Immutable Audit Logs**

**What Immutable Audit Logs Do Functionally:**

- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Cannot be modified or deleted once created
- **Database Triggers**: Automatic prevention of audit log changes
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Chain of custody verification using SHA-256
- **Compliance Assurance**: Meets government audit requirements
- **Forensic Integrity**: Maintains evidence quality for investigations

**Suitable Project Types:**

- Government systems
- Financial institutions
- Healthcare systems
- Legal compliance systems
- Critical infrastructure

**Limitations:**

- Storage growth over time
- Performance impact on writes
- Complex recovery procedures
- Regulatory retention requirements

**Alternatives:**

- **Blockchain**: Distributed immutable ledger
- **WORM Storage**: Write-once, read-many storage
- **External Audit Service**: Third-party audit logging
- **File-based Logs**: Immutable file system logs

### **Compliance Management**

**What Compliance Management Provides:**

- **Regulatory Requirement Tracking**: Automated compliance checking
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous risk evaluation and scoring
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated policy adherence monitoring
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive compliance documentation
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions

### **Audit Verification**

**What Audit Verification Provides:**

- **Chain Integrity**: Complete audit chain validation
- **Tamper Detection**: Automatic detection of unauthorized changes
- **Forensic Analysis**: Detailed evidence examination
- **Compliance Verification**: Regulatory requirement validation
- **Risk Assessment**: Security and integrity risk evaluation

## Immutable Audit System

### **Database Implementation**

The immutable audit system uses PostgreSQL triggers and functions to ensure:

1. **Automatic Logging**: Every data change is automatically logged
2. **Hash Chain**: Each record includes hash of previous record + current data
3. **Tamper Prevention**: Database triggers prevent modification/deletion
4. **Integrity Verification**: Functions to verify chain integrity
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance report generation

### **Key Features**

**Hash Chain Implementation:**

```sql
-- Each audit record includes:
- hash_chain: SHA-256 hash of (previous_hash + current_data)
- previous_hash: Hash of previous record
- block_number: Sequential block number
- is_immutable: Always true (enforced by constraint)
```

**Tamper Prevention:**

```sql
-- Triggers prevent modification:
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_immutable_audit_update
    BEFORE UPDATE ON immutable_audit_logs
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_audit_modification();
```

**Integrity Verification:**

```sql
-- Function to verify chain integrity:
SELECT * FROM verify_audit_chain_integrity();
```

### **Compliance Scoring**

**Score Calculation:**

- Weighted average of all requirements
- Each requirement scored 0.0 to 1.0
- Overall score: 0.0 to 1.0

**Status Determination:**
