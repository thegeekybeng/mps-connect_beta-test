Timestamp: 2025-01-04T00:00:00Z
Git HEAD (local): 5f39e0081d56b6b4f2d365244df00ad945afe7ba
Git remote: Not available from current shell (path quoting issue). Please run `git remote -v` in repo root.

## Achieved / Improvements

- Frontend (`mps-connect_testers/index.html`)

  - Unified "AI Analysis & Letter Generation" flow
  - Correct rendering of all main categories with confidence and sub-categories with selection
  - Dynamic state: readiness banner, per-category enablement, Generate All
  - MP-voice letters: addressee by main category; no raw citizen text; copy/download
  - Required-fields validation (starter set) per category
  - Explainability: selected categories + extracted facts with tooltips
  - Guided Chat mode: 8-step intake, compiles into analysis text
  - **NEW: Traffic Fines schema + slot engine with validators, confirmation chips, readiness meter**
  - **NEW: Schema integration into Guided Chat with conditional follow-ups**
  - **NEW: Required-field enforcement with 80% readiness threshold for letter generation**
  - **NEW: Feature flag system for approval controls (hidden by default)**
  - **NEW: In-memory persistence model for letter edits and explainability bundles**

- Backend (`mps-connect_testers/api/app.py`)
  - Lint fixes without behavior change: grouped sklearn imports; optional ImportError guards; lazy logging; narrowed exceptions; NumPy cosine fallback

## Outstanding / Not Yet Addressed

- **Chat Experience Enhancement (Priority)**

  - Personality & Tone: Warm, empathetic Singaporean assistant voice
  - Dynamic Conversation Flow: Context-aware branching and smart follow-ups
  - Emotional Intelligence: Recognize stress, offer reassurance, acknowledge difficulties
  - Enhanced UX: Typing indicators, progress bars, quick action buttons
  - Smart Content: Category-specific expertise, real-time validation, resource recommendations

- Approval Workflow Controls

  - Feature flag implemented; needs end-to-end approval handling

- Advanced Persistence
  - In-memory model complete; needs DB storage for production

## Upstream / Downline Impact

- Schema-driven slots → enables structured data collection; improves letter quality
- Enhanced chat experience → increases user engagement; reduces abandonment
- Required-fields enforcement → prevents low-quality letters; improves success rates
- Feature flags → enables controlled rollouts; safer deployments
- Persistence model → enables audit trails; supports compliance requirements

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Phase 1: Personality & Warmth Enhancement**

   - Rewrite chat questions with empathetic, Singaporean tone
   - Add acknowledgment responses and encouraging language
   - Include local references and emotional support

2. **Phase 2: Dynamic Conversation Flow**

   - Implement context-aware question branching
   - Add smart skip logic for irrelevant questions
   - Create priority-based question ordering

3. **Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience**

   - Add typing indicators and progress bars
   - Implement quick action buttons and navigation
   - Create summary confirmation screens

4. **Phase 4: Intelligence Layer**
   - Add sentiment analysis for tone adjustment
   - Implement context memory and smart validation
   - Create resource recommendations

## Verification
